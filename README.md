## Overview

Harmony Yield Boost is a decentralized finance application that allows users to enhance their yield returns on 1sDAI deposits. The protocol works by converting 1sDAI to boostDAI at a dynamic exchange rate that increases over time, effectively generating additional yield for users.

### Key Features

- ðŸš€ Enhanced APY through yield boosting mechanism
- ðŸ’± Dynamic exchange rate system
- âš¡ Instant deposits and withdrawals
- ðŸ”’ No lock-up periods
- ðŸ’° No minimum deposit requirements
- ðŸ“ˆ Transparent yield tracking

## Technical Details

### Exchange Rate Mechanism

The core of the yield boost system is based on an exchange rate mechanism:

- Initial rate: 1 boostDAI = 1.05 1sDAI
- The exchange rate increases over time, generating yield
- Users maintain a constant boostDAI balance while its 1sDAI value grows
- Current APY: 11.8%

### Fees

- Deposit Fee: 0.1%
- Withdrawal Fee: 0.1%

### Smart Contract Integration

The protocol integrates with:
- Sky Protocol (MakerDAO) for 1sDAI
- Harmony blockchain for transactions
- Treasury system for yield distribution
